# statistical-methods-for-testing-Credit-Scoring-Models


This Project is part of my Bachelorthesis. I implemented some statictical methods I used to test/compare different Credit-Scoring-Models. The Methdos are based on the article "Benchmarking state-of-the-art classification algorithms for credit scoring: An update of research" from Stefan Lessmann, Bart Baesens, Hsin-VonnSeowd and Lyn C. Thomas I modifyd some of the methdos for my Bachelorthesis (Brier Score) based on some related papers. Methods included:

    Brier Score (positive and negative)
    h-measure (not yet in Python)
    ROC-AUC
    partial Gini-coefficient (+ Lorenz curve)
    PCC
    Kolmogorov-Smirnov-Statistik ( + curves)

Final resulst are shown in a Dashboard realized with Dash.
